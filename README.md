# Stroop Test

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

This Shiny application delivers an interactive version of the classic
Stroop Test, designed for use in schools as part of the PSI Schools
Initiative. It provides a hands-on way for STEM students to explore data
collection, experimental design, statistical analysis, outlier detection
and data visualisation .

By running the test and analyzing their own data, students engage
directly with data collection, visualization, and
interpretation—building both scientific thinking and statistical
literacy in an accessible and engaging format.

## Installation

You can install the development version of AsthmaWorkshop from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PSI-schools/AsthmaWorkshop")
```

## Package Management with renv

This project uses renv to manage R package dependencies and ensure a
reproducible environment. When you first clone the repository, run the
following commands in your R session to restore the required packages:

``` r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

This will install all packages as specified in the renv.lock file. Any
new packages you install during development can be added to the lockfile
by running renv::snapshot(). For more information, see the [renv
documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/).

## Run Application in a Local Environment

If you wish to run the application on your own computer you can do so by
running the following code:

``` r
library(AsthmaWorkshop)
AsthmaWorkshop::run_app(s)
```

## Deploying the Application

### Persistent Storage

This application uses Google Sheets as a lightweight and collaborative
backend for persistent data storage. The googlesheets4 package allows
reading from and writing to Google Sheets securely using OAuth 2.0
authentication. To interact with a Google Sheet, you must first
authenticate using googlesheets4::gs4_auth() (in an interactive
session), or set up a service account for non-interactive use.

### Deploying to shinyapps.io

To deploy this Golem-based Shiny application to shinyapps.io, make sure
you have the rsconnect package installed and that you’re logged in with
your account credentials. Then, run the following command from the root
of the package directory:

### Sensitive Information

As a user-friendly way to handle credentials and sensitive information
.Renviron file is used. This information must not be uploaded to GitHub
(but is uploaded to shinyapps.io as at present it has no environmental
variable support)

To created this file

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "project")
```

Add the following lines, replacing the \[values\] with actual values:

Email=\[“Email”\] GoogleSheets=\[“GoogleSheets ID”\]

#### Authentication

This Shiny app uses a .secrets folder to securely store authentication
credentials for accessing Google Sheets. The .secrets folder contains a
JSON file generated by the Google Cloud Console, which is used for OAuth
authentication. The credentials are read by the googlesheets4 package
when the app starts, enabling seamless access to your Google Sheets data
without exposing sensitive information. Be sure to place your
authentication file in the .secrets folder and ensure it’s added to
.gitignore to keep it secure from version control.

### Colour Palette

The colour palette is stored as package data so it can be shared across
the application. See [R Packages: Data](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html)
for more details.

To update the colour palette, amend the /data-raw/MyPallette.R and run
the line at end of scripts.

``` r
usethis::use_data(MyPallette, overwrite = TRUE, internal = TRUE)
```
